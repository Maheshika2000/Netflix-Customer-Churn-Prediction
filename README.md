# Netflix-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn at Netflix using machine learning techniques. The goal is to spot customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions. This allows businesses to create effective retention strategies.

The project follows the complete data science workflow:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Machine learning model development (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation and comparison using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and feature importance

Business insights from predictive modeling

Tech Stack

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Database: MySQL (for data storage and management)

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau (for dashboard creation)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

Key Results

Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 0.894, ROC-AUC = 0.894

Random Forest: Accuracy = 0.952, ROC-AUC = 0.952

XGBoost: Accuracy = 0.992, ROC-AUC = 0.992 (Best Model)

The XGBoost model showed the best predictive performance and highlighted the most important features influencing customer churn.

Business Impact

Identifies high-risk customers for proactive retention campaigns

Provides insights into subscription behavior and engagement patterns

Supports decision-making to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty
